# My React Playground
A playground for experimenting with components I'm creating with React and TypeScript. Components in this repository shouldn't be used in production. Instead, I will be creating separate repositories for official components I want to publish publicly.

## Running
### Update & Install NPM Packages
```bash
npm update
npm install
```

### Start Dev Server
```bash
npm run start
```
